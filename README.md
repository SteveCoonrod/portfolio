# Portfolio
This is my gitHub repository for all potential employers to view

My name is Steve Coonrod, I am a Software Developer with a solid foundation in C# and the ADO.NET Framework, as well as the ASP.NET MVC framework, Java and the Java Web API. My experience is focused on designing and developing n-tier enterprise applications within an Agile workflow using test-driven development practices. 

As of May 2020 this repository shows demonstration code from my studies in the Software Development program at Kirkwood Community College.
