# Portfolio
Houses my code examples to be shared with potential employers

I am a Software Developer with a solid foundation in C# and the ASP.NET MVC Framework, as well as Java and the Java Web API. My experience is focused on designing and developing n-tier enterprise applications within an Agile workflow using test-driven development practices. 

This is my gitHub repository for all potential employers to view

As of May 2020 it shows demonstration code from the Software Developer program at Kirkwood Community College.
